# Engine (`polisyos.scientist.orchestration.engine`)

## Purpose

`polisyos.scientist.orchestration.engine` defines the Scientist workflow
runtime: state model, DAG execution, checkpoint/resume, idempotency, retry and
fan-out semantics, runner backends, and trace metadata shared across the
orchestration stack.

## Where to Start

- Stable facade and export map: [`__init__.py`](__init__.py)
- State and workflow contracts: [`state.py`](state.py) and [`workflow_spec.py`](workflow_spec.py)
- Core execution path: [`executor.py`](executor.py) and [`async_executor.py`](async_executor.py)
- Checkpointing and idempotency: [`checkpoint.py`](checkpoint.py) and [`idempotency.py`](idempotency.py)
- Remote/distributed runners: [`runner/`](runner/)

## Public Entrypoints

- State and spec contracts in [`state.py`](state.py) and [`workflow_spec.py`](workflow_spec.py): `ExperimentState`, `WorkflowSpec`, and `NodeInvocation`
- Node contracts in [`protocol.py`](protocol.py): `Node`, `NodeSpec`, `NodeOutcome`, `NodeError`, and `NodeStatus`
- Executors in [`executor.py`](executor.py) and [`async_executor.py`](async_executor.py): `WorkflowExecutor` and `AsyncWorkflowExecutor`
- Checkpoint helpers in [`checkpoint.py`](checkpoint.py): `resume_from_checkpoint(...)`, `acquire_run_lock(...)`, and workflow fingerprint utilities
- Idempotency/cache helpers in [`idempotency.py`](idempotency.py)
- Runner backends and configuration in [`runner/`](runner/): `WorkflowRunnerConfig`, `WorkflowRunnerBackend`, and `build_workflow_runner(...)`

Both executors publish `NODE_CACHE_STORE` after a successful cache-entry write.
A fresh executor in the same run restores exact entry refs from this trace or
checkpoint refs, then verifies the stored replay operations before applying
them to current state. An underlying CAS write that finishes after cancellation
is not admitted to the trace as a successful cached attempt.

Async cold recovery reads both trace and checkpoint entry refs through the same
bounded shared worker as ordinary cache I/O, with the caller's context and one
absolute workflow deadline. Recovery checks the read budget first and admits
its private cache only after a successful, unexpired await. Cancellation or a
bounded read timeout can leave a physical read running, but that worker cannot
publish into the executor's current cache. Without a configured workflow
deadline the shared helper's default 30-second read wait remains a cache bypass
limit, not a workflow deadline. Workflow execution receives the time remaining
after startup. Synchronous stores must support the existing shared-worker
ownership model; this path does not add support for thread-affine connections.

## Depends On / Depended On By

- Depends on: core artifacts, observability, tenant/security helpers, and node contracts consumed by workflow execution
- Depended on by: [`../api.py`](../api.py), [`../workflows/README.md`](../workflows/README.md), [`../nodes/README.md`](../nodes/README.md), and the Scientist engine test surface in [`../../../../tests/unit/scientist/README.md`](../../../../tests/unit/scientist/README.md)

## Common Commands

Run from the repository root (`policy-engine/`).

- Smoke-tested import check: `uv run python -c "from polisyos.scientist.orchestration.engine import ExperimentState, WorkflowExecutor, WorkflowSpec; print(ExperimentState.__name__, WorkflowExecutor.__name__, WorkflowSpec.__name__)"`
- Conceptual full-slice test run: `uv run pytest tests/unit/scientist/orchestration/engine -q`

## Test / Verification Commands

Smoke-tested:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit/scientist/orchestration/engine/test_condition.py tests/unit/scientist/orchestration/engine/test_retry.py tests/unit/scientist/orchestration/engine/test_state_merge.py -q
```
